# Chimeraforge

**70,000+ measurements. 26 technical reports. One consumer GPU. A shipped CLI tool.**

This repository contains everything behind Technical Reports TR108 through TR133 — source code, benchmark harnesses, datasets, logs, publish-ready technical reports, and the `chimeraforge plan` CLI that operationalizes the findings into deployment decisions. Every performance claim is backed by reproducible benchmarks, every number traces to raw data, and every finding is documented with full methodology.

## What This Repository Is About

Chimeraforge is the research and benchmarking breakout from the Banterhearts program. It contains every asset required to measure LLM inference performance, run the TR-series test plans, publish the technical reports, and ship the predictive capacity planner. Production APIs and orchestration services remain in Banterhearts; this repo stays focused on measurement, analysis, and deployment tooling.

The research program spans two completed phases:

- **Phase 1 (TR108-TR122):** Language comparison (Python vs Rust), multi-agent concurrency, backend benchmarking, cost/energy economics, scaling laws. 8,000+ runs.
- **Phase 2 (TR123-TR133):** KV-cache economics, quality baselines, quantization decision matrix, compile paradox resolution, context scaling, production workloads, N-agent scaling, serving stack comparison, GPU kernel profiling, and predictive capacity planning. ~62,000+ measurements.

Through **70,000+ measurements** across 26 Technical Reports, we've answered the fundamental deployment questions: which backend, which quantization level, which serving stack, how many agents, what context budget, and how to plan capacity — all validated on a single consumer GPU (RTX 4080 Laptop, 12 GB VRAM).

## Why Chimeraforge Exists

### For Decision Makers (CTOs, Engineering Leads, Product Managers)

**The Problem:** Choosing between Python and Rust for LLM agents is often a gut-feel decision. "Rust is faster" or "Python is easier" are common refrains, but what does "faster" actually mean? How much faster? Under what conditions? What are the trade-offs?

**The Solution:** This repository provides **quantified, reproducible answers** to these questions. Every performance claim includes:
- The exact hardware and software configuration used
- The methodology for measurement
- Raw data you can inspect and verify
- Statistical analysis showing confidence levels

**The Value:** Make informed decisions based on data, not assumptions. Understand when Rust's performance gains justify its development overhead. Know when Python's velocity is the right trade-off.

### For Engineers

**The Problem:** You need to optimize LLM agent performance, but configuration space is vast. GPU layer allocation, context window size, temperature settings, runtime choices — each affects performance differently. What's optimal for single-agent might not work for multi-agent. What works in Python might not translate to Rust.

**The Solution:** This repository provides:
- **Proven optimal configurations** for different scenarios
- **Reproducible benchmark harnesses** you can run yourself
- **Analysis tools** for understanding your own results
- **Source code** showing exactly how optimizations are implemented

**The Value:** Skip the trial-and-error phase. Start with configurations that are known to work, then customize based on your specific needs.

### For Researchers

**The Problem:** LLM performance research often lacks reproducibility. Papers cite numbers without providing code. Benchmarks use different hardware, different models, different methodologies. Comparing results across studies is difficult.

**The Solution:** This repository provides:
- **Complete methodology documentation** for every experiment
- **Raw data** in structured formats (CSV, JSON)
- **Reproducible code** that runs the exact same benchmarks
- **Statistical analysis** with confidence intervals and variance measures

**The Value:** Build on solid foundations. Reproduce our results, extend our analysis, or use our methodology for your own research.

## Quick Takeaways: What We Discovered

All findings below are verified across 70,000+ measurements documented in Technical Reports TR108 through TR133. Every number is reproducible and traceable to raw data.

### Single-Agent Performance: Rust vs Python

| Metric | What It Means | Python | Rust | Winner | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|--------|------|--------|----------------|
| **Throughput** | How fast the agent generates text (tokens per second) | 99.34 tok/s | 114.54 tok/s | 🏆 Rust (+15.2%) | Higher throughput = more work done per second. For high-volume systems, 15% faster means 15% more capacity or 15% lower costs. |
| **TTFT (Time to First Token)** | How long until the agent starts responding (milliseconds) | 1,437 ms | 603 ms | 🏆 Rust (-58%) | Lower latency = better user experience. Users perceive 58% faster response time as significantly more responsive. |
| **Memory Usage** | How much RAM the agent consumes | ~250 MB | ~75 MB | 🏆 Rust (-67%) | Less memory = more agents per server, lower infrastructure costs, better resource utilization. |
| **Startup Time** | How long until the agent is ready to work | 1.5 seconds | 0.2 seconds | 🏆 Rust (-83%) | Faster startup = better for serverless, containers, and auto-scaling scenarios. |
| **Consistency (CV)** | How much performance varies between runs (lower is better) | 4.8% | 2.6% | 🏆 Rust (-46%) | More consistent = more predictable = easier to plan capacity and set SLAs. |

**Source:** Technical Report 112_v2 (111 benchmark runs, 37 configurations)

**Bottom Line:** For single-agent workloads, Rust is faster, uses less memory, starts faster, and is more consistent. The performance advantage is substantial and consistent across all metrics.

### Multi-Agent Performance: Concurrent Execution

When running multiple agents simultaneously, the question becomes: **Can we achieve near-perfect parallelism, or does coordination overhead eat into the gains?**

| Scenario | What It Means | Python Result | Rust Result | Winner | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| **Peak Efficiency** | Best-case parallel efficiency (how close to 2x speedup with 2 agents) | 99.25% | 99.396% | 🏆 Rust (+0.15pp) | Near-perfect parallelism means you can double capacity with <1% overhead. Both languages achieve this, but Rust edges ahead. |
| **Mean Efficiency** | Average efficiency across all configurations | 95.8% | 98.281% | 🏆 Rust (+2.48pp) | Higher mean = more reliable performance across different workloads. Rust's advantage is more pronounced in average scenarios. |
| **Contention Rate** | How often agents compete for resources (lower is better) | 10-15% | 0.74% | 🏆 Rust (20x better) | Lower contention = more predictable performance, fewer slowdowns, better resource utilization. |

**Critical Requirement:** Both languages require **dual Ollama instances** (separate LLM servers on different ports) to achieve these results. Using a single Ollama instance caps Rust at 82.2% efficiency due to server-level serialization.

**Sources:** 
- Python: Technical Report 110 (150 benchmark runs, 30 configurations)
- Rust: Technical Report 114_v2 (135 benchmark runs, 27 configurations)

**Bottom Line:** For multi-agent workloads, both languages can achieve near-perfect parallelism, but Rust maintains a slight edge in consistency and contention handling.

### Optimization Success Rates

Not all configuration changes improve performance. Some make it worse. The question is: **How often do optimizations actually help?**

| Language | Success Rate | What It Means |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Rust** | 72.2% of configs beat baseline | When you try a new configuration, there's a 72% chance it will improve performance. This makes optimization more predictable and reliable. |
| **Python** | 38.9% of configs beat baseline | When you try a new configuration, there's only a 39% chance it will help. More trial-and-error required, but when it works, gains can be larger. |

**Sources:** Technical Report 109 (Python) and Technical Report 111_v2 (Rust)

**Bottom Line:** Rust's optimization is more reliable (higher success rate), but Python occasionally achieves larger peak improvements when optimization works. Rust is better for predictable, incremental gains. Python is better for exploratory optimization where you're willing to try many configurations.

### Runtime Choice (Rust Only)

Rust supports multiple async runtimes (Tokio, async-std, smol). **Which one should you use for production?**

| Runtime | Peak Efficiency | Mean Efficiency | Consistency (σ) | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Tokio-default** | 99.89% | 98.72% | 1.21pp | 🏆 **Recommended for production** - Best consistency, reliable performance |
| **Smol-1KB** | 99.94% | 98.61% | 1.32pp | ✅ **Alternative** - Slightly smaller binary, nearly as consistent |
| **Tokio-localset** | 99.99% | 97.95% | 4.03pp | ⚠️ **Avoid** - Highest peak but too variable (unpredictable) |
| **Smol** | 99.87% | 97.72% | 4.87pp | ❌ **Avoid** - Pathological failures (drops to 72.8% in some cases) |
| **Async-std** | 50.00% | 50.00% | N/A | ❌ **Unusable** - Perfect serialization (no parallelism) due to ecosystem conflicts |

**Source:** Technical Report 115_v2 (150 benchmark runs, 5 runtimes, 6 configurations each)

**Bottom Line:** Use **Tokio-default** for production. It's the most consistent and reliable. All working runtimes achieve ~100% peak efficiency, so consistency matters more than peak performance.

### Cross-Model Benchmarks (TR116)

**Question:** Does model choice (Gemma, Llama, Qwen) impact multi-agent coordination efficiency?

| Model | Rust Efficiency | Python Efficiency | Verdict |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Gemma 3** | **99.2%** | 84.9% | 🏆 **Best Scaling** |
| **Llama 3.1** | 98.5% | 85.8% | ✅ Excellent |
| **Qwen 2.5** | 90.0% | 77.6% | ⚠️ Throughput Imbalance |

**Key Findings:**
1. **Rust Dominates:** Rust is **+12-17pp more efficient** than Python across ALL models.
2. **Gemma 3 is King:** Achieves near-perfect 99.2% efficiency in Rust.
3. **Qwen Issues:** Throughput imbalance (+12 tok/s delta) hurts efficiency in both languages.
4. **Python Ceiling:** Python never exceeds 86% efficiency, regardless of model.

### Phase 2: Deployment Decisions (TR123-TR133)

Phase 2 produces a complete, artifact-backed deployment framework from ~62,000 measurements:

| Decision | Recommendation | Evidence |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Single-agent backend** | Ollama Q4_K_M | Highest throughput/dollar; quality within -4.1pp (TR123-TR125) |
| **Multi-agent backend (N>=4)** | vLLM FP16 | 2.25x advantage from continuous batching (TR130-TR132) |
| **Compile policy** | Prefill only, Linux, Inductor+Triton | 24-60% speedup; decode crashes 100% (TR126) |
| **Quantization** | Q4_K_M default; Q8_0 quality-critical; never Q2_K | Universal sweet spot across 5 models (TR125) |
| **Context budget** | Ollama for >4K tokens on 12 GB | VRAM spillover = 25-105x cliffs (TR127) |
| **Capacity planning** | `chimeraforge plan` | Validated R²>=0.859; beats M/D/1 by 20.4x (TR133) |

### `chimeraforge plan` — Predictive Capacity Planner

The CLI tool that operationalizes the entire research program:

```bash
pip install -e ".[all]"
chimeraforge plan --model llama3.2-1b --quantization Q4_K_M --backend ollama --agents 4
```

- Searches (model, quantization, backend, N-agents) space in <1 second
- 4-gate pipeline: VRAM feasibility → quality gate → latency gate → budget gate
- Validated: VRAM R²=0.968, throughput R²=0.859, quality RMSE=0.062, latency MAPE=1.05%
- No ML needed — empirical lookup tables with first-principles interpolation

### `chimeraforge bench` — Live Inference Benchmarking

Run real LLM inference benchmarks against a live backend (requires Ollama, vLLM, or TGI):

```bash
# Single-model benchmark (5 runs, single workload)
chimeraforge bench --model llama3.2-3b --runs 5

# Sweep all 7 quantization levels
chimeraforge bench --model llama3.2-3b --all-quants --json

# Context-length sweep
chimeraforge bench --model llama3.2-3b --context 512,1024,2048,4096

# Server workload with Poisson arrivals
chimeraforge bench --model llama3.2-3b --workload server --rate 2.0

# Use vLLM or TGI backend
chimeraforge bench --model llama3.2-3b --backend vllm --base-url http://localhost:8000
```

- Three workload profiles: single (sequential), batch (concurrent), server (Poisson arrivals)
- Measures throughput (tok/s), TTFT, latency with p50/p90/p95/p99 percentiles
- CV-based stability detection with automatic warnings
- JSON output for programmatic consumption

## Research Journey: Technical Reports TR108-TR133

Our research progressed systematically, with each report building on previous findings and answering specific questions. We've conducted **70,000+ measurements** across **26 technical reports** (TR108-TR133), covering single-agent performance, multi-agent concurrency, runtime optimization, backend comparisons, cost analysis, scaling studies, quantization, compilation, context scaling, serving stack comparison, GPU kernel profiling, and predictive capacity planning.

### TR108: Single-Inference Optimization
**Question:** What's the best configuration for a single LLM request?  
**Answer:** GPU=80 layers, Context=512 tokens, Temperature=0.8  
**Why It Matters:** Established the baseline for all future comparisons. Single-inference optimization is different from agent optimization.  
**Scale:** 150+ benchmark runs  
**Key Insight:** Optimal settings for simple requests don't necessarily work for complex agent workflows.

### TR109: Python Agent Workflow Optimization
**Question:** Do agent workflows need different settings than single requests?  
**Answer:** Yes! Agents work better with smaller context windows (512-1024 vs 2048) and have lower optimization success rates (39% vs higher for single-inference).  
**Why It Matters:** You can't just copy single-inference settings to agents. Agent workflows have different characteristics.  
**Scale:** 54 benchmark runs (18 configurations × 3 runs)  
**Key Insight:** Agent tasks require distinct optimization strategies. What works for one-shot requests doesn't work for multi-step workflows.

### TR110: Python Multi-Agent Concurrent Execution
**Question:** Can we run multiple Python agents at the same time efficiently?  
**Answer:** Yes! With dual Ollama instances, Python achieves 99.25% peak efficiency (nearly perfect parallelism).  
**Why It Matters:** Proves that multi-agent systems can nearly double capacity with minimal overhead. Critical for scaling.  
**Scale:** 150 benchmark runs, 30 configurations  
**Key Insight:** Dual Ollama architecture is essential. Single Ollama instance creates a bottleneck that prevents true concurrency.

### TR111_v2: Rust Single-Agent Performance
**Question:** How fast can a Rust agent go?  
**Answer:** 114.54 tokens/second baseline, which is 15.2% faster than Python's 99.34 tok/s.  
**Why It Matters:** First comprehensive Rust agent benchmark with full workflow parity (not just micro-benchmarks).  
**Scale:** 57 benchmark runs, 19 configurations  
**Key Insight:** Rust's performance advantage is real and substantial. The 15% throughput gain is consistent and reproducible.

### TR112_v2: Rust vs Python Single-Agent Comparison
**Question:** What are the real-world differences between Rust and Python for single agents?  
**Answer:** Rust is faster (15.2%), uses less memory (67% less), starts faster (83% faster), and is more consistent (46% better).  
**Why It Matters:** Comprehensive apples-to-apples comparison with identical workflows. Provides definitive data for decision-making.  
**Scale:** 111 benchmark runs, 37 configurations (19 Rust + 18 Python)  
**Key Insight:** Rust's advantages are consistent across all metrics. The performance gap is real and significant.

### TR113: Rust Multi-Agent (Single Ollama)
**Question:** What happens if we run Rust multi-agent with one Ollama instance?  
**Answer:** Efficiency caps at 82.2% because both agents share one inference queue, creating serialization.  
**Why It Matters:** Identified the architectural bottleneck. Proved that dual Ollama is necessary, not optional.  
**Scale:** 19 configurations (single-run exploratory sweep)  
**Key Insight:** Server-level serialization is the limiting factor, not Rust's async runtime.

### TR114_v2: Rust Multi-Agent (Dual Ollama)
**Question:** Does dual Ollama fix the bottleneck and enable true Rust concurrency?  
**Answer:** Yes! Rust achieves 98.281% mean efficiency and 99.396% peak efficiency, exceeding Python's 95.8% mean and 99.25% peak.  
**Why It Matters:** Validates that Rust can achieve near-perfect parallelism and even exceed Python in multi-agent scenarios.  
**Scale:** 135 benchmark runs, 27 configurations  
**Key Insight:** With proper architecture (dual Ollama), Rust's single-agent advantage translates to multi-agent superiority.

### TR115_v2: Rust Runtime Optimization
**Question:** Which Rust async runtime is best for multi-agent workloads?  
**Answer:** Tokio-default is recommended (98.72% mean, 1.21pp consistency). All working runtimes achieve ~100% peak, so consistency matters more than peak.  
**Why It Matters:** Provides production guidance. Peak performance is similar across runtimes, but consistency varies dramatically.  
**Scale:** 150 benchmark runs, 5 runtimes, 6 configurations each  
**Key Insight:** For production, choose based on consistency, not peak performance. Tokio-default is the most reliable.

### TR116: Cross-Model Multi-Agent Benchmarks
**Question:** Does model choice (Gemma, Llama, Qwen) impact multi-agent coordination efficiency?  
**Answer:** Yes! Gemma 3 achieves 99.2% efficiency in Rust (best scaling), while Python never exceeds 86% regardless of model.  
**Why It Matters:** Model choice affects scaling characteristics. Rust's advantages hold across all models, but some models scale better than others.  
**Scale:** 60+ multi-agent runs across 3 models  
**Key Insight:** Rust + Gemma 3 is the optimal combination for high-concurrency agent swarms.

### TR117: Cross-Backend Inference Benchmark & Multi-Agent Root Cause
**Question:** Which inference backend is fastest, and why does Python have an 86% efficiency ceiling?  
**Answer:** GPU-compile wins on mean latency (389ms), but plain GPU wins on median (323ms) - revealing the "compile paradox". Python's 86% ceiling is caused by event loop lag (16ms spikes).  
**Why It Matters:** Backend choice matters for latency, and Python's structural limitations prevent >86% efficiency in multi-agent scenarios.  
**Scale:** 3,017 inference runs + multi-agent root cause analysis  
**Key Insight:** Transformers-gpu-compile for best mean latency, but Python's event loop is the bottleneck preventing higher efficiency.

### TR118_v2.2: ONNX Runtime + TensorRT Deep Dive
**Question:** Can specialized runtimes (ONNX, TensorRT) beat PyTorch for inference?  
**Answer:** TensorRT-fp16 achieves best prefill latency (2.48ms, -87% vs baseline), but requires careful optimization.  
**Why It Matters:** Specialized runtimes can provide significant latency improvements for production workloads.  
**Scale:** Comprehensive ONNX/TensorRT optimization study  
**Key Insight:** TensorRT offers substantial gains but requires infrastructure investment.

### TR119: Cost & Energy Analysis
**Question:** What are the cost and energy implications of different backends?  
**Answer:** onnxruntime-gpu provides best cost efficiency ($0.1279/1M tokens on-demand).  
**Why It Matters:** Cost and energy efficiency are critical for production deployment at scale.  
**Scale:** Comprehensive cost/energy economics analysis  
**Key Insight:** Backend choice significantly impacts operational costs.

### TR120: The "Compile Paradox" Root-Cause Audit
**Question:** Why does GPU-compile win on mean but lose on median?  
**Answer:** TR117 compile label was misattributed; shape stability is the critical factor, not compilation itself.  
**Why It Matters:** Understanding the true cause of performance differences enables better optimization strategies.  
**Scale:** Root-cause analysis of compile paradox  
**Key Insight:** Shape stability matters more than compilation for consistent performance.

### TR121v1: Model Scaling Study
**Question:** How does performance scale from 5M to 20B parameters?  
**Answer:** Scaling pipeline established, demonstrating performance characteristics across model sizes.  
**Why It Matters:** Understanding scaling behavior is essential for choosing appropriate model sizes.  
**Scale:** Model scaling study from 5M to 20B parameters  
**Key Insight:** Performance characteristics vary significantly with model size.

## Understanding the Metrics

### Throughput (Tokens per Second)
**What it is:** How many tokens the agent generates per second. A token is roughly 0.75 words.  
**Why it matters:** Higher throughput = more work done per second = better capacity utilization = lower costs.  
**Real-world impact:** 15% faster throughput means you can handle 15% more requests with the same hardware, or use 15% less hardware for the same workload.

### TTFT (Time to First Token)
**What it is:** How long from when you send a request until the agent starts generating a response.  
**Why it matters:** Users perceive latency, not throughput. 58% faster TTFT feels significantly more responsive.  
**Real-world impact:** Faster TTFT = better user experience = higher user satisfaction = better product metrics.

### Memory Usage
**What it is:** How much RAM the agent process consumes.  
**Why it matters:** Less memory = more agents per server = better resource utilization = lower infrastructure costs.  
**Real-world impact:** 67% less memory means you can run 3x more Rust agents than Python agents on the same hardware.

### Parallel Efficiency
**What it is:** For multi-agent systems, how close you get to perfect parallelism. 100% = perfect (2 agents = 2x speedup), 50% = no benefit (2 agents = 1x speedup).  
**Why it matters:** High efficiency means you can scale horizontally with minimal overhead. Low efficiency means adding agents doesn't help much.  
**Real-world impact:** 99% efficiency means doubling your agent count nearly doubles your capacity with <1% overhead. This is critical for scaling.

### Contention Rate
**What it is:** How often agents compete for the same resources (GPU, memory, network), causing slowdowns.  
**Why it matters:** Lower contention = more predictable performance = easier capacity planning = better SLAs.  
**Real-world impact:** 0.74% contention means agents rarely interfere with each other. 15% contention means frequent slowdowns and unpredictable performance.

### Coefficient of Variation (CV)
**What it is:** A measure of consistency. Lower CV = more consistent performance.  
**Why it matters:** Consistent performance = predictable capacity = easier planning = better user experience.  
**Real-world impact:** 2.6% CV means performance is very predictable. 4.8% CV means more variation, making capacity planning harder.

| **TR119** | What are the cost/energy implications? | onnxruntime-gpu: $0.1279/1M tokens (on-demand), best cost efficiency. | Backend choice significantly impacts operational costs and energy consumption. |
| **TR120** | Why does GPU-compile win mean but lose median? | TR117 compile label misattributed; shape stability is critical, not compilation. | Understanding true cause enables better optimization. Shape stability matters more than compilation. |
| **TR121v1** | How does performance scale with model size? | Scaling pipeline established from 5M to 20B parameters. | Understanding scaling behavior essential for choosing appropriate model sizes. |
| **TR122** | What are the physics of inference on consumer GPUs? | RTX 4080 idles at 20.71W, V2 poller achieves 100ms grid. | Foundational power/thermal characterization for all subsequent work. |
| **TR123** | What does KV-cached inference actually cost? | Best cost $0.013/1M tokens (GPT-2/compile, chat blend). | Phase-split economics across 5 models, 3 backends, 5 workloads. |
| **TR124** | Does backend choice affect output quality? | No — 0/7 ANOVA metrics significant across 5 models. | Enables pure cost-driven backend selection. |
| **TR125** | Which quantization level should we deploy? | Q4_K_M universal sweet spot (-4.1pp max); Q2_K unacceptable. | 26,000 samples, 34 model-quant variants, real MMLU+ARC benchmarks. |
| **TR126** | Does torch.compile actually help? | Yes on Linux (24-60% prefill speedup); crashes decode. | Resolves Phase 1 compile paradox; 916 real Triton kernels generated. |
| **TR127** | What happens at long context lengths? | VRAM spillover causes 25-105x cliffs; sub-linear below capacity. | Two-regime discovery reshapes all context-length planning. |
| **TR128** | How does production load behave? | NUM_PARALLEL is a no-op (0/30 significant); M/D/1 deviates 20.4x. | Refutes two common assumptions about GPU inference scaling. |
| **TR129** | How do N agents scale on one GPU? | Amdahl s=0.39-0.54; throughput plateaus at N=2. | Per-agent efficiency degrades monotonically; fairness excellent. |
| **TR130** | Which serving stack scales best? | vLLM 2.25x advantage at N=8 via continuous batching. | First head-to-head: Ollama vs vLLM vs TGI at scale. |
| **TR131** | What's the real scaling bottleneck? | GPU memory bandwidth (+74% stress at N=8), not serving stack. | Overturns TR130; PyTorch Direct degrades worse than Ollama. |
| **TR132** | How does continuous batching work at kernel level? | 77-80% kernel reduction, 79-83% bandwidth-per-token reduction. | Proves the mechanism; vLLM and TGI use identical amortization. |
| **TR133** | Can we automate capacity planning? | Yes — 4/4 validation targets met; `chimeraforge plan` shipped. | Empirical lookup tables outperform theoretical queueing models. |
