# TR118v2.1 Critical Issues Summary

**Status:** Report has significant errors requiring correction  
**Date:** 2025-12-13  
**Verification:** All 5 verification scripts completed

---

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. ❌ Perplexity Calculation Error (Section 8.1)

**Issue:**
- Report claims: perplexity ~50,286
- Report explanation: exp(ln(50257)) ≈ 50286
- **Actual calculation:** exp(ln(50257)) = 50,257.00
- **Error:** Report has wrong value (off by 29)

**Impact:** Minor - doesn't affect conclusions but shows calculation error

**Fix:** Update Section 8.1 to show correct value (50,257) or explain the discrepancy

---

### 2. ❌ Crossover Point Has Massive Uncertainty

**Issue:**
- Report claims: crossover at 30-50M parameters
- **3-point power-law fit:** crossover = 435.60M parameters
- **2-point power-law fit:** crossover = 56.56M parameters
- **95% Confidence Interval:** [43.85M, 891.01M] - **847M range!**

**Impact:** CRITICAL - The crossover point is essentially unknown with current data

**Root Cause:**
- Only 3 data points (0.103M, 11M, 124.4M)
- Power-law fit is unstable with sparse data
- Large gap between 11M and 124.4M (11× jump)

**Fix Required:**
- Add more data points (0.5M, 1M, 2M, 5M, 10M, 50M, 100M)
- Re-fit with proper least-squares
- Report confidence intervals, not point estimates
- Acknowledge uncertainty in report

---

### 3. ⚠️ TRT Failure Classification Broken

**Issue:**
- All 200 failures classified as "hard" (0 soft, 0 unknown)
- Report claims some are "soft" (timeout on uncached generate)
- Classification logic too strict - only looks for specific error strings

**Impact:** Medium - Misclassifies failures, obscures real issue

**Root Cause:**
- Error messages don't clearly distinguish timeout vs profile mismatch
- Need to check if prefill worked (indicates engine valid)
- Current logic: if error contains "timeout" AND no hard indicators → soft
- But errors may not contain "timeout" string explicitly

**Fix Required:**
- Improve classification: check if prefill succeeded for same backend
- If prefill OK but generate fails → likely soft (uncached issue)
- If both fail → likely hard (engine/profile issue)
- Re-analyze with better logic

---

### 4. ⚠️ Power-Law Fit Quality Issues

**Issue:**
- R² = 0.9955 (good fit)
- But k = -0.370 ± 0.051 (from report: k ≈ -0.28)
- Large difference suggests fit instability
- Bootstrap CI for crossover is huge (847M range)

**Impact:** Medium - Fit looks good but predictions unreliable

**Root Cause:**
- Sparse data (3 points)
- Non-linear fit sensitive to outliers
- 11M point may be pulling fit in unexpected direction

**Fix Required:**
- Add more data points
- Try alternative fits (exponential, polynomial)
- Report fit quality metrics (R², RMSE, AIC)
- Acknowledge model uncertainty

---

### 5. ✅ Break-Even Math - CORRECT

**Status:** Verified correct (0.2% difference from report)

---

### 6. ✅ Run Counts - CORRECT

**Status:** All counts verified (720 total, 360 prefill, 360 generate)

## Severity Assessment

| Issue | Severity | Impact | Fix Priority |
|-------|----------|--------|--------------|
| Crossover uncertainty | **CRITICAL** | Report's main finding is unreliable | **P0** |
| TRT failure classification | **HIGH** | Misrepresents failure types | **P1** |
| Power-law fit quality | **MEDIUM** | Predictions unreliable | **P1** |
| Perplexity calculation | **LOW** | Minor error, doesn't affect conclusions | **P2** |

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (P0 - Critical)

1. **Acknowledge crossover uncertainty in report**
   - Add disclaimer: "Crossover point highly uncertain (95% CI: 43-891M)"
   - Don't claim "30-50M" as fact
   - State: "Estimated crossover: 30-50M (large uncertainty)"

2. **Add more data points for crossover validation**
   - Test models at: 0.5M, 1M, 2M, 5M, 10M, 50M, 100M
   - Re-fit power-law with 7-10 points
   - Calculate proper confidence intervals

### Short-term (P1 - High)

3. **Fix TRT failure classification**
   - Improve logic: check prefill success for same backend
   - Re-classify: prefill OK + generate fail → soft
   - Update Section 7 with correct breakdown

4. **Improve power-law analysis**
   - Try alternative models (exponential decay, piecewise)
   - Report fit diagnostics
   - Acknowledge model limitations

### Long-term (P2 - Low)

5. **Fix perplexity calculation**
   - Update Section 8.1 with correct value
   - Or explain discrepancy if intentional

---

## What Makes This "Garbage Tier"

1. **Main finding is unreliable:** Crossover point has 847M uncertainty range
2. **Misclassified failures:** All TRT failures marked "hard" when some are likely "soft"
3. **Unstable fits:** Power-law parameters vary significantly with different methods
4. **Sparse data:** Only 3 points for a non-linear fit is insufficient
5. **Overconfident claims:** Report states "30-50M" as fact when CI is 43-891M

---

## Path to "Production-Ready"

1. **Add 4-7 more data points** (0.5M, 1M, 2M, 5M, 10M, 50M, 100M)
2. **Re-fit with proper methods** (least-squares, bootstrap CI)
3. **Fix failure classification** (check prefill success)
4. **Acknowledge uncertainty** (report CIs, not point estimates)
5. **Re-generate report** (TR118v2.2 with corrections)

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 days to add data points + 1 day to fix analysis + 1 day to regenerate report

---

## Conclusion

TR118v2.1 has **critical reliability issues** with its main finding (crossover point). The report needs:
- More data (4-7 additional model sizes)
- Better statistical analysis (proper CIs)
- Honest uncertainty reporting
- Fixed failure classification

**Recommendation:** Mark report as "Preliminary" or "Draft" until data is expanded and analysis corrected.
