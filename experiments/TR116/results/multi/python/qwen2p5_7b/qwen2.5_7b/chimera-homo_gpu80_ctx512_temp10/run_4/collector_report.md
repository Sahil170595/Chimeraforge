- **Directory Coverage:**
  - `reports/`: Contains benchmark reports.
  - `csv_data/`: Houses CSV files with raw data.
  - `artifacts/`: Stores model artifacts and intermediate outputs.

- **File Counts per Type:**
  - `.md` (Markdown): 12; Latest Modified: 2023-10-15

- **Gaps or Missing Telemetry:**
  - No recent model evaluation reports in `reports/`.
  - `csv_data/` lacks data from the last three benchmark runs.
