- **Directory Coverage:**
  - `reports/`: Contains analytical reports on various benchmarks and system performance evaluations.
  - `csv_data/`: Stores raw data from various experiments in CSV format, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs).
  - `artifacts/`: Houses benchmark artifacts including logs, snapshots, and configuration files.

- **File Counts per Type:**
  - `.md`: 12 reports; latest modified timestamp: 2023-11-15.
  - `.csv`: 72 data files; latest modified timestamp: 2023-11-18.
  - `.json`: 40 configuration and metadata files; latest modified timestamp: 2023-11-16.

- **Gaps or Missing Telemetry:**
  - No recent (post-2023-11-18) CSV data files.
  - Only one report has been updated since the last benchmark cycle, suggesting a possible gap in continuous reporting.
  - Several artifact files are older than 7 days, indicating potential gaps in real-time monitoring.

These metrics and observations should help ensure comprehensive evaluation of the system's performance and identify areas for improvement.
