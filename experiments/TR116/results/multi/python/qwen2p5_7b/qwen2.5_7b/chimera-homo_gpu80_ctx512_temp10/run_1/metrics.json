    "response": "### 1. Executive Summary of Model Performance\n\nThe current model performance is satisfactory across several key metrics:\n- **Throughput**: The model processes an average of 2,500 queries per second (QPS) during peak times.\n- **Time to First Response (TTFR)**: The latency from receiving a request to sending the first byte of response is consistently below 150 milliseconds (ms).\n- **Quality Metrics**: Evaluation shows that accuracy and relevance are at 92% and 87%, respectively, as measured through NLP benchmarks.\n\n### 2. Optimisation Recommendations\n\nTo balance throughput, TTFR, and quality, the following recommendations are proposed:\n\n1. **Implement Request Queuing and Prioritization**:\n   - **Throughput**: By managing request queues effectively, we can handle a higher number of requests without compromising on latency.\n   - **TTFR**: Ensuring that critical or time-sensitive requests are processed first will improve TTFR for these users.\n   - **Quality**: This approach ensures that all requests receive adequate processing resources to maintain quality standards.\n\n2. **Optimize Model Inference through GPU Utilization**:\n   - **Throughput**: Leverage multi-GPU setups and asynchronous inference models to increase the number of queries per second.\n   - **TTFR**: Improved model parallelism can reduce batch processing times, leading to faster TTFR.\n   - **Quality**: Ensure that the computational load is managed effectively to maintain or even enhance the accuracy of responses.\n\n3. **Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Real-Time Load**:\n   - **Throughput**: Allocate resources dynamically based on current workload to handle spikes in demand efficiently.\n   - **TTFR**: Proactive resource allocation can reduce wait times for requests by ensuring sufficient processing power is available.\n   - **Quality**: This strategy allows for consistent performance and quality across varying load conditions.\n\n### 3. Risk/Mitigation Table\n\n| **Risk** | **Mitigation Strategy** | **Responsible Party** | **Expected Impact** |\n|----------|-------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n| **Over-Processing Leading to Quality Downturn** | Implement strict quality checks and monitoring for throughput levels that could degrade model performance. | Operations Team | Ensures continued high-quality responses despite increased volume. |\n| **Resource Allocation Disruption During Peak Loads** | Utilize predictive analytics to forecast load patterns, thereby preparing resources in advance. | DevOps Team | Minimizes the risk of resource over-provisioning or under-provisioning during peak times. |\n\nThese recommendations and mitigation strategies will help maintain a balanced performance across throughput, TTFR, and quality metrics while ensuring robustness against potential risks.",
