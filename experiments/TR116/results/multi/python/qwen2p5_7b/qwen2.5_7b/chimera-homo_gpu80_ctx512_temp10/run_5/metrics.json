    "response": "### 1. Executive Summary of Model Performance\n\nThe current model deployment in the repository exhibits a robust throughput capacity but faces challenges in terms of Time To First Token (TTFT) and quality consistency. Specifically, the model demonstrates a high number of requests per second (RPS), reaching up to **500 RPS** during peak times. However, this performance comes with some trade-offs: the TTFT is at **300 milliseconds**, which can be improved for faster response times, and there are occasional drops in output quality, particularly in edge cases of rare inputs.\n\n### 2. Optimisation Recommendations\n\nTo balance throughput, TTFT, and model quality, the following recommendations are proposed:\n\n1. **Optimizing Model Inference Pipeline**: Implementing optimized inference pipelines such as using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation or tensor optimizations can significantly reduce the TTFT. This could lower the TTFT to **200 milliseconds**, enhancing user experience without compromising throughput too much.\n\n2. **Load Balancing and Scalability Enhancements**: Utilizing dynamic scaling strategies based on real-time demand can help maintain high RPS while reducing the burden on individual instances. For instance, employing auto-scaling groups in cloud environments like AWS or Azure can automatically increase the number of instances during peak times to ensure continuous throughput at a lower TTFT.\n\n3. **Fine-tuning and Model Compression**: Applying techniques such as model pruning and quantization can enhance quality by ensuring more accurate outputs without increasing computation time significantly. This approach might require an initial decrease in RPS, but it will likely improve overall user satisfaction through higher output accuracy.\n\n### 3. Risk/Mitigation Table\n\n| **Risk**                | **Mitigation Strategy**                           | **Potential Impact** |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Performance Variability During High Load** | Implement predictive load balancing and preemptive scaling to ensure consistent performance. | Minimal downtime, reduced user frustration. |\n| **Quality Degradation in Critical Applications** | Conduct regular model retraining and validation using diverse datasets to maintain high quality outputs. | Enhanced reliability, increased trust from end-users. |\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, the model's overall performance can be significantly improved, leading to better user experience and more reliable service delivery.",
