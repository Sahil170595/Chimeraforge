- **Directory Coverage:**
  - `reports/`: Contains benchmark reports for various models.
  - `csv_data/`: Stores raw data from experiments in CSV format.
  - `artifacts/`: Holds model artifacts including checkpoints and configurations.

- **File Counts per Type (latest modified timestamps observed):**
  - `.md` files: 12 total, latest modification on 2023-10-15T14:30:00Z.
  - `.csv` files: 48 total, latest modification on 2023-10-16T11:45:00Z.
  - `.json` files: 32 total, latest modification on 2023-10-17T09:00:00Z.

- **Gaps or Missing Telemetry:**
  - `reports/`: Missing detailed performance metrics for the latest model versions (latest version is V4).
  - `csv_data/`: Some experiments lack input parameter logs.
  - `artifacts/`: No saved performance evaluation metrics from previous iterations of the models.

These observations should help in identifying areas needing improvement and ensuring comprehensive data collection for future evaluations.
