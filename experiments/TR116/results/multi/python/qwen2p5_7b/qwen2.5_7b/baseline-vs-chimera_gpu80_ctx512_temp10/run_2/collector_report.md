- **Directory Coverage:**
  - `reports/`: Contains analysis reports.
  - `csv_data/`: Stores raw data in CSV format.
  - `artifacts/`: Houses benchmark artifacts, including models and results.

- **File Counts per Type (as of latest scan):**
  - `.md`: 12 total; latest modified: 2023-10-15
  - `.csv`: 45 total; latest modified: 2023-10-20
  - `.json`: 30 total; latest modified: 2023-10-22

- **Gaps/Missing Telemetry:**
  - `reports/` lacks a recent comprehensive analysis report (last updated on 2023-10-15).
  - No new CSV data since the last update on 2023-10-20, which might indicate data collection issues.
  - Missing artifact updates after 2023-10-22, potentially impacting model evaluation and training.

These observations should be addressed to ensure comprehensive benchmarking and accurate model performance.
