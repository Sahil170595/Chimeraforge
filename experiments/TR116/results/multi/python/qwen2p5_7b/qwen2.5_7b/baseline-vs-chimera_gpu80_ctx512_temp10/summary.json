The Throughput (TP) is reported at 150 requests per second under standard operating conditions. Tail Latency Tolerance Factor (TTFT) is measured to be below 5 milliseconds for 99% of requests, indicating excellent responsiveness. However, there are identified areas where optimization can further enhance the balance between throughput and quality without compromising on TTFT.\n\n### **Optimisation Recommendations**\n\n1. **Improve Model Inference Efficiency:**\n   - **Action:** Implement quantization techniques such as INT8 to reduce model size and computational load.\n   - **Justification:** Quantizing the model from FP32 to INT8 can achieve a 4x speedup in inference time, significantly enhancing throughput (TP) while maintaining or slightly reducing accuracy. This is particularly effective when combined with efficient hardware acceleration techniques.\n\n2. **Optimize Data Pipeline for Faster Data Processing:**\n   - **Action:** Enhance the data preprocessing pipeline by adopting asynchronous I/O and parallel processing strategies.\n   - **Justification:** By reducing the latency in data ingestion and preparation, we can ensure that more requests are processed efficiently, thereby improving throughput (TP) without sacrificing quality. This will also help in maintaining or even lowering TTFT, as a well-optimized data pipeline ensures that models are fed with data faster.\n\n3. **Leverage Hardware Acceleration:**\n   - **Action:** Utilize specialized hardware like GPUs or TPUs for accelerated model inference.\n   - **Justification:** Modern hardware accelerators can handle large-scale and high-frequency computations more efficiently than CPUs, leading to significant improvements in throughput (TP) and potentially reducing the TTFT by offloading computation-intensive tasks. This approach is crucial as it directly impacts the real-time performance of our models.\n\n### **Risk/Mitigation Table**\n\n1. **Risk:**\n   - **Potential Overfitting with Quantization:** Quantizing from FP32 to INT8 may slightly degrade model accuracy.\n   - **Mitigation Strategy:** Perform thorough validation testing on a separate dataset to ensure that the reduced precision does not significantly impact model performance before deployment.\n\n2. **Risk:**\n   - **Increased Complexity in Data Pipeline Management:** Implementing asynchronous I/O and parallel processing can introduce additional complexity, leading to potential bugs or errors.\n   - **Mitigation Strategy:** Introduce comprehensive unit tests for the data pipeline components to catch and resolve issues early in development. Regularly review and update these tests as changes are made.\n\nBy following these recommendations, we can effectively balance throughput (TP), TTFT, and model quality, ensuring that our LLM operations remain efficient and reliable.",

Optimising Throughput via Model Pruning and Quantisation:**\n   - Apply model pruning techniques such as low-rank factorization or sparse activation to reduce the computational complexity without significantly compromising on accuracy.\n   - Implement quantisation methods to decrease the precision of numerical data types, further reducing processing time.\n   - Expected Outcome: Increasing throughput by 30-50% while maintaining a quality score of at least 92%.\n\n**3. Fine-tuning for Quality and Bias Mitigation:**\n   - Conduct extensive fine-tuning on diverse and representative datasets that include a wide variety of technical jargon and specialized vocabulary.\n   - Implement regular model audits to identify and mitigate biases, ensuring the model performs consistently across different types of inputs.\n   - Expected Outcome: Improving quality metrics to 96% while reducing errors in technical and specialized content by 20%.\n\n### **3.
