  - `csv_data/`: Stores detailed data records in CSV format.
  - `artifacts/`: Houses benchmark artifacts, including models and configurations.

- **File Counts per Type (latest timestamps):**
  - `md` files:
    - Count: 15
    - Latest Modified Timestamp: 2023-10-09 14:30:00 UTC
  - `csv` files:
    - Count: 78

- **Gaps or Missing Telemetry:**
  - No recent model evaluation reports in the `reports/` directory (last update was on 2023-10-02).
  - Several `csv` files older than a week, indicating potential data staleness.
  - A missing artifact version control log in the `artifacts/` directory.

These observations can guide further analysis and ensure comprehensive model evaluation.
