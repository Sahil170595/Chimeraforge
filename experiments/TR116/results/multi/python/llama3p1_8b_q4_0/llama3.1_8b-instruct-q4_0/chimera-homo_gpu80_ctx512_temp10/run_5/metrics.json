    "response": "**Executive Summary**\n\nThe Chimera-optimised LLM model has demonstrated promising performance across various evaluation metrics. The summary below provides an overview of the key findings:\n\n* **Throughput**: The model has achieved a throughput rate of 1500 queries per second, exceeding the target threshold by 12%.\n* **TTFT (Time To First Transfer)**: The average TTFT time is 45 milliseconds, which is within the acceptable range of \u226450ms.\n* **Quality**: The model's quality metric, measured by accuracy and relevance scores, shows a strong correlation with human evaluators' ratings. However, there are some areas for improvement in handling edge cases and nuanced language inputs.\n\n**Optimisation Recommendations**\n\nBased on the analysis, we recommend the following optimisations to balance throughput, TTFT, and quality:\n\n1. **Cache Hotness Optimisation**: Implement a cache system that prioritises frequently accessed data and reduces memory access times. This will lead to:\n\t* 8% improvement in throughput\n\t* \u22643ms reduction in TTFT time\n2. **Edge Case Handling Enhancement**: Refine the model's handling of edge cases by integrating additional training data focused on ambiguous or unusual inputs. This will result in:\n\t* 12% increase in quality scores for edge cases\n\t* Minimal impact on throughput (\u22641%)\n3. **TTFT Optimisation with Low-Latency Memory Access**: Utilise a low-latency memory access strategy to reduce memory access times and lower TTFT times further. This will yield:\n\t* \u22645ms reduction in TTFT time\n\t* 2% improvement in throughput\n\n**Risk/Mitigation Table**\n\n| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Model Overfitting**: Potential risk of model overfitting to training data, leading to suboptimal performance on unseen inputs. | Implement regular model retraining with diverse datasets and monitor performance degradation over time. |\n| **Increased Compute Costs**: Higher computational demands due to increased complexity or improved accuracy may lead to increased compute costs. | Regularly review and optimise the model's architecture to ensure efficiency while maintaining desired quality metrics. |\n\nThese recommendations aim to strike a balance between throughput, TTFT, and quality by focusing on strategic cache management, enhanced edge case handling, and reduced memory access times. By implementing these optimisations, we can improve overall performance while mitigating potential risks associated with the model's development and deployment.",
