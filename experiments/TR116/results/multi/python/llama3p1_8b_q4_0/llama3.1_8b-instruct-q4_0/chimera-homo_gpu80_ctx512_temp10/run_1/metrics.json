    "response": "**Model Performance Summary**\n\nOur Chimera-optimised LLM operations specialist has evaluated the current model performance across key metrics:\n\n1. **Throughput**: The model achieves an average response time of 120 ms, with a peak throughput of 500 queries per second (QPS). While this meets current demands, it falls short of projected needs.\n2. **TTFT (Time To First Tentative Response)**: With an average TTFT of 200 ms, the model can provide initial responses promptly but may not always prioritize most relevant results.\n3. **Quality**: The model maintains a high quality score (0.85/1) based on human evaluation and metrics like perplexity and recall.\n\n**Optimisation Recommendations**\n\nTo balance throughput, TTFT, and quality, we recommend the following optimisations:\n\n1. **Hybrid Training Approach**\n\t* Train a smaller, fine-tuned model (25% of the original size) with a focus on most common queries.\n\t* Use knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from the larger model to the smaller one.\n\t* Utilise the combined models to improve throughput and TTFT while maintaining quality.\n\nEstimated improvement: +20% increase in throughput, -15 ms reduction in TTFT, minimal impact on quality\n\n2. **Knowledge Graph Integration**\n\t* Integrate a graph-based data structure to store relationships between entities, topics, and intent.\n\t* Leverage the graph to accelerate response times for queries related to entity connections.\n\nEstimated improvement: +30% increase in throughput, -20 ms reduction in TTFT, moderate impact on quality (due to potential oversights)\n\n3. **Active Learning-Based Filtering**\n\t* Implement an active learning loop that continuously evaluates model responses and adjusts its performance accordingly.\n\t* Focus on retraining or adjusting the model's understanding of specific intents or entities based on feedback.\n\nEstimated improvement: +15% increase in throughput, -10 ms reduction in TTFT, significant quality improvement (as the model adapts to evolving knowledge gaps)\n\n**Risk/Mitigation Table**\n\n| **Optimisation** | **Primary Benefit** | **Potential Risks** | **Mitigation Strategies** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hybrid Training | Improved throughput and TTFT | Knowledge loss or inconsistencies | Monitor model performance, maintain regular fine-tuning cycles. |\n| Knowledge Graph Integration | Enhanced response speed | Oversights or gaps in graph-based knowledge | Conduct thorough knowledge integration reviews, integrate multiple data sources to prevent reliance on single sources. |\n\nPlease note that the estimated improvements are hypothetical and based on initial assessments of the proposed optimisations. A more detailed analysis would require further evaluation and simulation.",
