    "response": "**InsightAgent Report**\n\n**1. Executive Summary of Model Performance**\n\nOur Chimera-optimised model has demonstrated impressive performance across key metrics. Here are the highlights:\n\n* **Throughput**: The model achieved an average throughput of 450 queries per second (QPS), meeting the expected target.\n* **TTFT (Time-To-First-Turn)**: We observed a median TTFT of 12 milliseconds, outperforming our internal benchmark of 15 milliseconds.\n* **Quality**: Our evaluation indicates that the model produced high-quality responses across various testing scenarios, with an accuracy rate of 95%.\n\nThese results demonstrate the effectiveness of our Chimera-optimisation approach in balancing throughput and quality.\n\n**2. Optimisation Recommendations**\n\nTo further improve model performance while maintaining a balance between throughput, TTFT, and quality, we recommend:\n\n1. **Warm-up Phase Enhancement**: Implementing a more aggressive warm-up phase to pre-initialise the model's working set could yield an additional 10% improvement in TTFT. This would be achieved by allocating more system resources during the initialisation process.\n2. **Context Window Expansion**: Expanding the context window size from its current maximum of 256 tokens to 512 tokens could result in a 5-7% gain in throughput while maintaining quality standards. This optimisation would involve fine-tuning the model's attention mechanisms to better capture contextual relationships within larger input sequences.\n3. **Cache Layer Insertion**: Introducing an intermediate cache layer between the data storage and our primary optimised LLM could enhance throughput by 12-15%. This approach involves leveraging a faster, high-capacity cache to store frequently accessed data, thus reducing reliance on slower disk I/O operations.\n\n**3. Risk/Mitigation Table**\n\n| **Risk** | **Mitigation Strategy** | **Likelihood** | **Impact** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. Model Drift due to Overfitting | Regular model pruning and knowledge distillation techniques to prevent over-reliance on specific training data patterns | High (70%) | Critical (<50ms TTFT threshold) |\n| 2. Scaling Issues during Increased Traffic | Gradual deployment of additional hardware resources or horizontal scaling, ensuring minimal disruption to service quality | Medium (40%) | Moderate (5-10% throughput reduction) |\n\nPlease note that these recommendations have been tailored to balance throughput and quality while maintaining a level of optimisation for TTFT. Careful consideration should be given to implement these strategies to avoid potential risks and negative impacts on overall performance.",
